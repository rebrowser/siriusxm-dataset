![Updated](https://img.shields.io/badge/updated-2026--02--18-brightgreen?style=flat-square)&nbsp;![Records](https://img.shields.io/badge/records-59.3M-blue?style=flat-square)&nbsp;[![Rebrowser](https://img.shields.io/badge/full%20dataset-rebrowser.net-orange?style=flat-square)](https://rebrowser.net/products/datasets/siriusxm)

Satellite radio channel lineup with genres, categories, channel numbers across platforms, and real-time play-by-play track history across SiriusXM music channels.


The [SiriusXM dataset](https://rebrowser.net/products/datasets/siriusxm) on Rebrowser is **free** — but GitHub has file size and storage limits, so this repo contains a limited sample. For the full dataset (59.3M records, updated daily), visit [rebrowser.net/products/datasets/siriusxm](https://rebrowser.net/products/datasets/siriusxm).


This dataset contains **2** entities, each in its own folder: Radio Channels (`channels`), Channel Plays (`channel-plays`). See below for a full field breakdown, sample counts, and data distributions for each.
